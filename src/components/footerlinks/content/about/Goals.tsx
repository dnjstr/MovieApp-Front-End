            <p className="text-gray-400 mb-4">While Movie Haven started as a college project, we have big dreams for its future. Our goals include:</p>
            <ul className="space-y-4 text-gray-400">
              <li><strong>Expanding Our Content Library</strong> – We aim to build a vast collection of film-related content, including in-depth reviews, thought-provoking essays, 
              and detailed film analyses. Our goal is to cover a wide range of genres, from classic films to modern blockbusters, independent cinema, and international masterpieces.</li>
  
              <li><strong>Introducing Guest Contributions</strong> – To bring diverse perspectives, we plan to collaborate with film scholars, critics, and industry professionals. Their 
              insights will enrich our platform, providing valuable knowledge on film history, storytelling techniques, and industry trends.</li>
  
              <li><strong>Hosting Interactive Events & Discussions</strong> – We want to create a vibrant community where movie lovers can come together to share their thoughts and ideas. 
              In the future, we plan to organize live discussions, virtual film clubs, watch parties, and Q&A sessions with filmmakers and experts.</li>
              
              <li><strong>Developing Multimedia Content</strong> – To make learning about films more engaging, we will introduce podcasts, video essays, and even online courses. 
              These resources will offer deeper insights into filmmaking, screenwriting, cinematography, and film theory.</li>
              
              <li><strong>Encouraging Community Engagement</strong> – We want Movie Haven to be more than just a website; we want it to be a place where people can 
              connect. In the future, we plan to introduce features such as user-submitted reviews, discussion forums, and interactive polls where users can share 
              their opinions on different movies.</li>
              
              <li><strong>Exploring Partnerships & Collaborations</strong> – To expand our reach, we hope to collaborate with film organizations, schools, and online 
              platforms to bring more valuable content to our audience.</li>
