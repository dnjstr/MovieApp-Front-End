            We are a team of passionate students from the University of Science and Technology, working together 
            on Movie Haven as part of our APDev course project. Our team—Glen, Den, Cyril, and Sophie—shares a deep love for movies and storytelling.

            Each of us brings unique skills and perspectives, from researching film history to curating content and engaging with the community. Though we come from different 
            backgrounds, our common goal is to create a platform where movie lovers can explore, learn, and discuss cinema. Through Movie Haven, we hope to share our passion 
            and make film education fun and accessible for everyone!
