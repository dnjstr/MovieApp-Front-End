            Movie Haven started as a college project by students from the University of Science and 
            Technology for our APDev course. Our team—Glen, Den, Cyril, and Sophie—was assigned to 
            create a movie app, and we worked hard to achieve the best grade.

            What began as a school assignment soon turned into a passion project. We love movies and 
            storytelling, so we wanted to create a platform where people can explore, learn, and talk 
            about films. Movie Haven is for students, movie lovers, and anyone who enjoys cinema. Our 
            goal is to make learning about movies fun and interesting!
