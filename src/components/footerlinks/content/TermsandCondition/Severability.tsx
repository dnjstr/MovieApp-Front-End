          If any provision, clause, or portion of these terms is determined to be unlawful, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable under applicable law, such provision shall be deemed modified 
          to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable while maintaining its original intent as closely as possible. If such modification is not feasible, the provision shall be deemed 
          severed from these terms, and the remaining provisions shall continue to be valid, binding, and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.

          The determination that any part of these terms is unenforceable shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provisions. The parties agree that they would have 
          entered into this agreement and each provision therein, even if they had foreseen that certain provisions might later be deemed invalid or unenforceable. In such cases, 
          the remaining provisions shall be interpreted in a manner that best fulfills the original intent and purpose of the agreement.

          Furthermore, if any provision is found to be unenforceable due to its scope, duration, or other factors, it shall be enforced to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law. 
          No waiver of any provision, term, or condition by either party shall be considered a further or continuing waiver of such provision or any other term. Each provision of these terms 
          operates independently, ensuring that the agreement remains functional and legally binding, even if modifications or severances are required to comply with applicable laws.
